                In ArcGIS: intersected community layer with land use layer to tag land use zones with towns. Then took that layer and intersected it (separately) with the NFHL flood zone layer. I then exported the layer data to comma separated files and imported those into MS Excel. In excel: removed all nonresidential land use zones from the data set, and then all flood zones that didn’t have anything to do with floods (such as the undetermined zones, the floodway zones that represent lake and river beds, the “not in flood zone” zones, etc.). Calculated total residential land and residential land in “coastal high hazard zones” and the 500 and 100 year flood zones, and calculated percent of residential land in each zone type. Coastal high hazard zones can overlap other zones, which means that totals for each community sometimes add up to over 100% on the totals – EPHT should not use totals for that reason. Calculated population assuming that it was evenly distributed in residential zones – multiply town population (2015 estimated) by percent of residential land to get populations in specific hazard zones are more informative for assessing vulnerability.

                The Impervious Surface raster layer represents impervious surfaces covering the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The surfaces were extracted using semi-automated techniques by Sanborn Map Company from 50-cm Vexcel UltraCam near infrared orthoimagery that was acquired in April 2005 as part of the Color Ortho Imageryproject. The pixel size for the impervious surface data is 1-meter.
